# Recommender-System
Implementing personalized recommendation systems has been viewed as a crucial differentiator in online streaming by most over-the-top (OTT) media service providers. This report demonstrates the process of developing a proof-of-concept recommendation engine for a startup online movie platform firm. The model uses individual film ratings gathered from 98 current UC Davis MSBA students and 280 anonymous users. Three candidate algorithms, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Matrix Factorization â€“ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and a memory-based approach, have been chosen for the study. The matrix factorization model outperforms the other two approaches in the scenario at hand and is the model we chose. As further proof of concept, we also deal with the cold start item problem with historical data, and the cold start user problem using an item-based approach. The discussion is concluded by detailing how this system can benefit businesses in an entertainment and retail setting through boosted customer lifetime value and increased retention.
